# Computer-Vision-for-Schizophrenia-Detection
An endeavor to create a Computer Vision project to detect Schizophrenia using 2D/3D CNNs from MRI data.

# Dataset
We will make use of the 4D fMRI data from the [UCLA](https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000030/) dataset, under the revision 1.0.5. The data were preprocessed with the fMRIPrep pipeline.
